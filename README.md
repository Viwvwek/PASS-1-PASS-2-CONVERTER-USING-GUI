# Machine Code Converter

## Overview
The Machine Code Converter is a GUI-based application that simulates a two-pass assembler. It allows users to input assembly code, perform Pass 1 to generate a symbol table, and perform Pass 2 to generate machine code. The application is built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical interface.

## Features
- **Two-Pass Assembler**: Simulates the first and second passes of an assembler.
- **Symbol Table Generation**: Automatically generates a symbol table during Pass 1.
- **Machine Code Generation**: Produces machine code in Pass 2 using the generated symbol table.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive interface for inputting assembly code and viewing outputs.
- **Customizable Themes**: Supports different themes for the GUI.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
